                    <h1>Our Vision</h1>
                    <p>Quantum mechanics gradually arose from theories to explain observations which could not be
                        reconciled
                        with classical physics, such as Max Planck's solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation
                        problem,
                        and from the correspondence between energy and frequency in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper which
                        explained the photoelectric effect. Early quantum theory was profoundly re-conceived in the
                        mid-1920s by Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born and others. The modern theory is
                        formulated in various specially developed mathematical formalisms. In one of them, a
                        mathematical
                        function, the wave function, provides information about the probability amplitude of position,
                        momentum, and other physical properties of a particle.</p>

                    <h2>Vision Is Important</h2>
                    <p>Never surrender your hopes and dreams to the fateful limitations others have placed on their own
                        lives. The vision of your true destiny does not reside within the blinkered outlook of the
                        naysayers and the doom prophets. Judge not by their words, but accept advice based on the
                        evidence of actual results. Do not be surprised should you find a complete absence of anything
                        mystical or miraculous in the manifested reality of those who are so eager to advise you.
                        Friends and family who suffer the lack of abundance, joy, love, fulfillment and prosperity in
                        their own lives really have no business imposing their self-limiting beliefs on your reality
                        experience.”

                    <p>“The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet,
                        everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond
                        themselves.”

                    <h2>Some Facts About Vision</h2>
                    <p>Throughout the centuries there were men who took first steps down new roads armed with nothing
                        but their own vision. Their goals differed, but they all had this in common: that the step was
                        first, the road new, the vision unborrowed, and the response they received — hatred. The great
                        creators — the thinkers, the artists, the scientists, the inventors — stood alone against the
                        men of their time. Every great new thought was opposed. Every great new invention was denounced.
                        The first motor was considered foolish. The airplane was considered impossible. The power loom
                        was considered vicious. Anesthesia was considered sinful. But the men of unborrowed vision went
                        ahead. They fought, they suffered and they paid. But they won.”
                        ― Ayn Rand</p>
